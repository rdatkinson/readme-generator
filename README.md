# readme-generator

## Description
This project is a README generator, created with the purpose of helping developers speed up their workflow by quickly and conveniently generating a professional README, including a folder with the contents, right from the command line.

## Installation
Node.js is required to be installed on the user's local machine to take advantage of this tool.

## Usage
The user should open their terminal (either the integrated terminal within their project folder in their IDE, or by navigating to their project folder within their machine's native terminal), and run the command "node index.js" to trigger the functionality of the tool and be taken through the questions to generate the README. Below, I have included a video walkthrough as a visual aid of the functionality.
